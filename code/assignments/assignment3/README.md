# ASSIGNMENT 3

## Directions

Create a database, clear the screen and write temperatures to database using SQLite3, by modifying the blinkTemp.py script.

### Creating a database

1. Create a New Directory called log under the assignment folder.

```bash
mkdir log
```
The reason for creating a subdirectory is simple. It enables the end user to keep their data organized.

2. Switch to log directory and create a new .db file using "touch".

```bash
cd log
touch tempLog.db
```
If you create the database ahead of time, when you are adjusting it in the SQLite console session (next step) you can just tab it in, avoiding any mistakes and also making the experience slightly less frustrating. I am real lazy so this helps.

3. Start a SQLite3 console session.
```bash
sqlite3
```
This is the part where we set up the database.

4. Create table.

**NOTE**: Due to formatting related nonsense, text is ideal for both the date and temp fields.

```bash
sqlite> CREATE TABLE tempRecord(Date TEXT, Temp TEXT);
```
Now that the tables are created, you can import previous tables as well as add new records.

5. (OPTIONAL) Import previous data from a .CSV file.

If you have data that you have previously saved inside a CSV (Comma Separated Values) files, you can import it using the following method.

```bash
sqlite> .mode csv
sqlite> .header on
sqlite> .import tempRecord.csv tempRecord.
```
In the case of this assignment I had some data stored in a CSV file prior to creating the sqlite3 database, so I figured it would be a good idea to import it into the database for simplicity's sake.
I also decided to select everything inside to verify that the data had been successfully imported.

```bash
sqlite> SELECT * FROM tempRecord;
```

6. Save the table into the .db file.

```bash
sqlite> .save tempLog.db
```
This will enable us to use the database inside of the python script.

7. Return to parent directory and nano the python script.

```bash
cd ..
sudo nano blinkTemp.py
```

8. At the top of the python script import the sqlite3 library, connect the database, create a cursor and commit the changes.

```python
import sqlite3

db = sqlite3.connect('./log/tempLog.db')
cursor = db.cursor()
db.commit()
```
This enables us to easily use the database at our leisure anywhere inside the script that we please, by using the variable db, as well as the cursor which enables us to execute commands, like updating the tables

9. Insert acquired data into table, and display.

**NOTE**: In order not to complicate this, I will not detail how the data is acquired or how it can be formatted to text. For more details please see blinktemp.py. 

Let us suppose that the variable *timeNow* contains the current time in text format, and the variable *data* contains the current temperature, also text formatted.

```python
cursor.execute('''INSERT INTO tempRecord VALUES(?,?)''', (timeNow, data))
db.commit()
all_rows = cursor.execute('''SELECT * FROM tempRecord''')
os.system('clear')
for row in all_rows:
	print('{0} : {1}'.format(str(row[0]), row[1],))
```

10. Add a close command at the end of your program, at the point where you want the database closed.
```python
db.close()
```

# END
